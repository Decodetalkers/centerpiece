# Hey ðŸ‘‹

If you are looking for my current (working) omnibox search setup, you can find it here: <https://github.com/friedow/dotfiles/tree/main/modules/launcher>. It is rofi based with a lot of custom plugins implemented in nushell, all configured in nix ;).

I recently experimented with onagre + pop launcher as a omnibox setup because rofi got really slow with an increasing amount of plugins. You can find these experiments here: <https://github.com/friedow/dotfiles/tree/main/modules/onagre>. This is onagre + pop-launcher + custom plugins in nushell, all configured in nix of course.

To address the elephant in the room: This repository is another experiment of implementing all of the above in rust ðŸ˜…. I think this is my sixth attempt of getting this right, so please don't expect anything finished here soon ðŸ˜‹.

## Centerpiece

Centerpiece is a omnibox search for linux.
